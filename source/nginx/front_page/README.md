# DJI Cloud API

## What is the DJI Cloud API?

The launch of the Cloud API mainly solves the problem of developers reinventing the wheel. For developers who do not need in-depth customization of APP, they can directly use DJI Pilot2 to communicate with the third cloud platform, and developers can focus on the development and implementation of cloud service interfaces.
